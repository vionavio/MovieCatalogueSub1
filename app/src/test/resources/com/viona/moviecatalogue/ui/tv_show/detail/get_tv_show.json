Although they are required to take tests daily, the children are free to spend their time as they see fit, usually playing outside, as long as they do not venture too far from the orphanage — a rule they are expected to follow no matter what. However, all good times must come to an end, as every few months, a child is adopted and sent to live with their new family... never to be heard from again.\n\nHowever, the three oldest siblings have their suspicions about what is actually happening at the orphanage, and they are about to discover the cruel fate that awaits the children living at Grace Field, including the twisted nature of their beloved Mama.",

An irreplaceable home for the 38 children that all live happily every day, even if they were strangers at first.\n\nUntil suddenly, their lives are completely changed forever… The happy days at Grace Field House ended abruptly.\n\nIn truth, their home is a farm, and the children are just human meat, food for the demons. Meanwhile, the Mom they love is a watchdog.\n\n“I don’t want any more of my family to die!”\n\nWith that one wish, Emma and the other children begin to gradually uncover the truths behind their lives.
